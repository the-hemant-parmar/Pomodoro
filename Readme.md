# The Pomodoro Reminder

-   It will have `work_time`, `break_time` and audio to be played as a reminder,
-   The reminder will play whenever the work_time and break_time is over (I should also have options to turn it ON/OFF)
-   Can also pause and resume the timer when needed, otherwise it will be an infinite clock switching between work and break
-   Default work_time will be 30 minutes and default break time will be 5 minutes.

### Edition

-   Changes background when changing modes
-   Hide the details in another page
-   Pressing space button pause and resume the timer !
